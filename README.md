Step 4: If the user selects "Save and Exit", the workbook will automatically save with all changes and will close.

## Summary

The userform allows organizations to have 3 usernames and passwords but other macros can be created to add other users. Currently, use "username1", "username2", or "username3" as the user names and "123" as passwords. The form is currently reflecting counties in Florida, but this can de replaced by other states. A dashboard is displayed to visualize the data. There are hidden sheets used to analyze the data. These sheets can be viewed by changing the macro or simple uncommenting (See Image 4).
