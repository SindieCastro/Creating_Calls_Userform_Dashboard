# Creating_Calls_Userform_Dashboard

Created a userform for an organization to document customer calls and a dashboard

## Purpose
To create a userform for organizations to document their call volume, reason for calls, and location of calls.

## Results
The userform allows organizations to have 3 usernames and passwords but other macros can be added to add other users. Currently, use "username1" as the user name and "123" as password (See Picture 1). The form is currently reflecting counties in Florida, but this can de replaced by other states.

A dashboard is displayed to visualize the data. Picture 2 shows displays the dashboard. There are hidden sheets used to analyze the data. These sheets can be viewed by changing the macro or simple uncommenting (See Picture 3).
